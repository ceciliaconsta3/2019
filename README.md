# 2019
A year in review

## :point_right: Progress
Back at it folks. This year my focus is above all, my health and staying involved in the micro ecosystems I'm already a part of. Checking up on friends, learning alongside others, growth, networking, having fun, dipping into my hobbies, building a solid work ethic, discipline and positive reputation, while providing value. The fundamental soft skills. I plan to be an awesome-to-work-with software engineer in the near future. Gotta start sometime.

The Disclaimer: Depending on time constraints and unforeseen circumstances, I may add some content or remove items that have been made redundant or irrelevant so that at the end of the year an accurate self-audit can be made. Anything I don't complete this year and is still viable will be added to next year's list.
