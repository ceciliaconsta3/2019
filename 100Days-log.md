## Day 8: Jan 10
### Today's Progress
- [X] Applied Accessibility
- [X] Responsive Web Design
#### Thoughts 
<p>Determine to get some real coding done outside of work, I went through the above sections fairly quickly due to previous experience. Pretty cool to actually breeze through some material instead of living in Struggle &trade; City the whole time. At work I'm about to start creating my first JQuery carousel with content dynamically added through an AJAX call using endpoints from the WordPress REST API. So far I've got the object titles, featured image, and post link to display on the page. Next is to build out the carousel's functionality. Last is the styling. Also, there may be an opportunity to dive into React and React Native on the horizon. FeelsGoodMan.</p>

## Day 7: Jan 9
### Today's Progress
- [X] Chapter 2
#### Thoughts 
<p>What a lovely day. Received a compliment from a senior coworker along the lines of 'hope to build more amazing things together'. It's nice to know that I'm able to help with the skills I'm learning and exercising.</p>

<p>Today was a light study/coding session. Meaning, literally fell asleep at my desk approaching the self test portion of the chapter. Still counting today because I typed the code alongside reading. Wondering if I should create separate files in this repository for some of those notes...As a full-time student and employee, maintaining the balance between the two alongside any side projects and daily chores, can get hectic. I recommend to anyone else having issues with time management to chill out and spend a week physically documenting when you switch tasks. Note the time and activity you just finished, much like having a food log. This way, you get a good sense of where your time is really being spent and what you actually find yourself doing. (Un)fortunately, since starting a few days ago, I've found myself using that log for a myriad of other forms of documentation including grocery lists, TODO, and these log entries. No complaints because I know what work I have and haven't performed. There's no pressure to keep up appearances.</p>
<p> To everyone taking this challenge and striving to better themselves in 2019 know this - you are what you repeatedly do. So long as you are taking consistent baby steps toward your hopes and dreams while maintaining your integrity and solidifying a positive character, you can do "it".</p>

>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then is not an act, but a habit. - Will Durant / Aristotle

## Day 6: Jan 8
### Today's Progress
- [X] Chapter 1 - Java Fundamentals
#### Thoughts 
<p> Embarrassed to note this but I got a end of chapter (EOC) question wrong so I punished myself by jumping back to chapter one content. Taking things much slower than before so I can retain all that I've learned this time. Memory retention and spaced repetition are proven to go hand in hand.</p>
<p> Did something I've never done before at work. Teamed up with another developer in utilizing the WordPress REST API. The idea is to pull blog posts by author and dynamically add this information in a custom page that would lead the end-user to purchase products referenced by the content writer. Basically, using the blog articles as CTAs, call it another way to beef up conversions without spending more marketing dollars.</p>
<p>First time making an AJAX call and returning a JSON object. In order to populate the page with the required content I had to add a parameter to the query string inside the call (necessary to reach the desired endpoint) so I could access the embedded content, create objects from the items I needed, and return them in the regular response. Not sure if that's the best way to describe it but we'll work on learning the proper terminology as the project develops.</p>
<p> I saw all this to say: </p>

>I googled, I thought, and I got it done :thumbsup:

## Day 5: Jan 7
### Today's Progress
- [X] Chapter 2

#### Thoughts 
<p> Had an interesting idea for a side work-related productivity program while reading about the main function in Java that accepts arguments. You see, we use a few excel sheets filled with promotion related material that needs to be added to the site weekly and monthly. This information needs to be cleaned. So tabs need to be created, checklists managed, sheets filtered and sorted, columns scanned for duplication, the whole shebang. What if I create a bash script that would open a file in a given directory and perform all of these small functions for me? Yes, there are such things as macros but my idea sounds more exciting at this point in my life so humor me.</p>
<p>The first step would be to sit and record how much time I spend completing this process manually on one workbook. Next step is to compile a list of each action needed to complete a task - the algorithm - and finally start small and see if I can implement the task automatically. Of course, this would take some more research and I would need to shore up on the feasibility of implementing this program. We need to see how much time, hypothetically, would it take me to create such a program as well. The limiting factor would just be my understanding. If it works, we save some time. If it fails, we go back to doing things manually and I would be just a tad bit wiser on things I had not yet known. </p>

## Day 4: Jan 6
### Today's Progress
- [X] Continued reading about short-circuit/conditional operators and the like
#### Thoughts 
Seems like I left off on the Java Masterclass a bit ahead of this book's contents. Since I didn't have a lot of time today to prioritize coding project, opted to catch up on some reading and light tinkering instead. Spent the day unpacking boxes and participating in my first home inspection. Exciting and scary stuff. Someone told me a decent analogy about the house buying process. :point_down:

>Unless you're building a new home, buying a house is just like buying a very expensive used car. Pick what price range and level of wear and tear you're comfortable with, pay the man, and turn the keys already.

## Day 3: Jan 4-5
### Today's Progress
- [X] Fleshed out study plan for WGU, FreeCodeCamp, and mobile app timeline
- [X] Learned about literals, escape sequences and reviewed basic Java data types
- [X] Experimenting with Markdown syntax
#### Thoughts 
<p>Actually fell asleep at my desk today so completing this log at the time of my waking, which happens to be...4:55am the following day. It's been interesting to see how many baby steps are involved in completing just one of my 2019 goals. The amount of planning and scheduling I've put into this challenge and goal pursuit is giving me an nostalgic wave of neuroticism.</p>

<p>Started back up on an old but highly recommended and continuously updated comprehensive Java course for auditory and visual learning while picking where I left off on Ch. 2* (Data types and Operations) to cover the written visual learning aspect</p>

## Day 2: Jan 3
### Today's Progress
- [X] Smooth scrolling "Back to Top" button using CSS and vanilla JS - I know, I know JQuery can do it all
- [X] Read a few pages and fiddled with examples way too early in my Java book

#### Thoughts
Had an enlighting talk with my boss today. The first time in awhile I've ever felt so strongly about getting a promotion, having more responsibility, learning and breaking my brain on new languages. Scary and exciting stuff. I love it.

Also, I'm about ready to jump off of the old #teamnosleep bandwagon but I've got coursework and papers to sign. Time management has to be one the most crucial skills I need to absolutely master in my adult life. Future me depends on it. Can't let her down.

## Day 1: Jan 2
### Today's Progress
- [X] Set up initial repository for goal tracking
- [X] Configured and added external accounts for more accurate metrics and additional accountability (PSN, Goodreads, etc.)
- [X] Unboxed my Java book and contacted student mentor for class schedule

#### Thoughts
Day one. Wanted to clear my work area and gather all my materials to provide least bit of resistance going forward. 
Even swiped the small bookshelf from the living room so everything is in one place.
