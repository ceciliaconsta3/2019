### Thoughts 
<p>Actually fell asleep at my desk today so completing this log at the time of my waking, which happens to be...4:55am the following day. It's been interesting to see how many baby steps are involved in completing just one of my 2019 goals. The amount of planning and scheduling I've put into this challenge and goal pursuit is giving an endearing touch of neuroticism.</p>

<p>Started back up on an old but highly recommended and continuously updated comprehensive Java course for auditory and visual learning while picking where I left off on Ch. 2* (Data types and Operations) to cover the written visual learning aspect</p>

# Day 2: Jan 3
## Today's Progress
- [X] Smooth scrolling "Back to Top" button using CSS and vanilla JS - I know, I know JQuery can do it all
- [X] Read a few pages and fiddled with examples way too early in my Java book

### Thoughts
Had an enlighting talk with my boss today. The first time in awhile I've ever felt so strongly about getting a promotion, having more responsibility, learning and breaking my brain on new languages. Scary and exciting stuff. I love it.

Also, I'm about ready to jump off of the old #teamnosleep bandwagon but I've got coursework and papers to sign. Time management has to be one the most crucial skills I need to absolutely master in my adult life. Future me depends on it. Can't let her down.

### Thoughts
Day one. Wanted to clear my work area and gather all my materials to provide least bit of resistance going forward. 
Even swiped the small bookshelf from the living room so everything is in one place.
