# #100DaysOfCodeChallenge: Round 2

#### I've decided to rejoin this challenge for a number of reasons, but mainly to accomplish the following:
* To help me keep myself accountable
* Get inspired by the thousands who code alongside me
* Increase my knowledge in advance web technologies, basic software engineering  and best practices
* Develop my own personal brand

Follow my Progress through [GitHub](https://github.com/ceciliaconsta3/2019) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ceciliaconsta3). Feedback is always welcome and if you're just getting started as well, feel free to join me on this journey.

## Specs

<p>For every day I code outside of work, I will post, update, and/or share a repo of what I did that day.</p>
<p>These one hour coding sessions will involve working on a project, client work or following some strucutured curriculum with hands-on examples (i.e. Java textbook, coursework, or Freecodecamp).</p>
<p>The goal is to progress in sound practical knowledge and skills, not breezing through the curriculum for bragging rights. During these days, I might share a few code snippets or link to some awesome resource I found either in the log or on Twitter.</p>
